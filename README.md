# ARIES-archive
This repository contains Python scripts developed for the ARIES Data Archive Project to automate real-time data handling from three national astronomical telescopes. The scripts monitor incoming data, verify FITS files, extract metadata, organize observations, and generate logs to support reliable daily archival operations.
